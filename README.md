      <blockquote>
       Coding in college was not easy for me–I’m an artist by trade.  It was no small task to take my “artist brain” and reconfigure it to accommodate both the strokes of a pen and strings of code.

So, why did I do it?  

I’ve taught many people how to make beautiful designs and drawings throughout my time at Drexel University as a designer and animator and now I can use the tools learned from Resilient Coders to bolster my own creativity while also making practical solutions not only for myself, but for other black and brown people who have been marginalized and forgotten.  

Through persistence coupled with my design skills and the tools of Javascript, Node, and React, I aim to create projects that are not only flawlessly coded, but easy on the eyes, too.
